# 🐍 Introduction to Python Programming – Projects & Practice

Welcome to my Python journey! 🚀  
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects, exercises, and real-world applications developed as part of my learning process while studying **Introduction to Python Programming**.

Each project and script reflects the concepts, syntax, and logic practiced throughout the course — from basic programming skills to more complex applications using external libraries like `pandas`, `openpyxl`, and more.
